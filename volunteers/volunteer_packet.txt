2014 GHC OpenSource Day - Volunteer Packet

Grace Hopper Open Source Day will include a Code-a-thon for Humanity, where attendees will collaboratively write code to help make the world a better place. This event, open to all skill and experience levels, will engage members of the open source community.

Volunteer Responsibilities:

There will be two types of volunteers:
 
 Floating volunteer type:  
  Duties: 
   help with the room setup / necessary equipment checklist,
   rearrangements before and after presentation/learning sesssions,demo schedule, any other on the spot requirements,
   Will need a sub-set of the floating volunteers to distribute the participants into pre-defined groups based on their skills and background by Oct 3 EOD (each group should have a mixed skill type)
   Agenda Hand outs - preparation and distribution

 Group Leader volunteer type: 
 Duties:
  Deploy the sample Ushahidi application using Heat (point of contact - Egle) / write/test scripts for server orchestration (point of contact - Iccha) and perform rigorous testing by Sept 30 EOD.
  Have a separate etherpad for issues you observed while testing each track project. Help fix/ notify the point of contact about the same, improvize by Oct 4.
  Have a working demo of the project ready on your laptop in case it is needed.
  General workflow for participants would be creation of a github repo and then contributing to it in the course of the project. 
 
Below is the rough volunteer workflow:
	-Presentation
 	-We break into smaller groups – roughly groups of 5-6 and each group having a lead volunteer.
 	-Goal is for each group to address at least one or more scaling use case.
  		-The volunteer first explains the basic set up of repo to the participants and talks to them and gauges their
  		 level of familiarity.
		-For example the group decides to write script for basic load balancer and two servers.
		 They can clone the humanitarian repo and use it to import the code they need to spin up servers or ha proxy.
		-Each group creates their own github repo so individuals can contribute to it. They can either fork this repo
		 or use it as requirements in their own repo.
		-Case-1.py is an example script we have in our humanitarian repo
		-The group is welcome to expand and use cloud files or other lib cloud features to address other use cases. 
		-Encourage participants to test the use cases, for example by deleting server-1, show that the load balance
		 ip still loads because server-2 is running.
		-The volunteer for each group must have a working demo for the group.
		-The volunteers will be given the credentials to share with their group for the purpose of the exercise. 
		-The repo will have clean up scripts which the participants are encouraged to use in cases where their
		 script fails, so that we do not exceed out quota.
		-If the group seems technical enough best practices like using virtualenv is encouraged.
		-We can pick some of the participants to demo different use cases during the demos.

Other volunteer duties:
	-All volunteers are encouraged to contribute to the repo and improve the code or text if they have any suggestions.
	 Pull requests are welcome.
	-Volunteers are encouraged to play around with the code, have familiarity with lib cloud and have a working demo
	 for their groups.
	-Volunteers are encouraged to think of other scalability use cases their groups could implement.
